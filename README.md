# Barry Sheehan ðŸ‘‹
I am a full-stack software developer working with a nonprofit in the AgTech sector in Ireland.

At work, I build with PHP and Laminas MVC, Oracle Database (SQL and PL/SQL), JavaScript and jQuery.

I also have experience with HTML, CSS, Bash, Java and Python.

A former graphic and multimedia designer, I'm also a musician with an interest in *all* types of music (try me!).
