## 😃 I am...
A software developer in the last semester of Computer Science at GMIT, as well as an erstwhile web development instructor. I'm also a graphic design and multimedia professional with 3+ years of experience.

Besides that, I'm a musician who's been known to strum a guitar, pick a sitar, slap a bodhrán, strain my vocal chords, or just let a computer do the work for me, all with varying levels of success.
